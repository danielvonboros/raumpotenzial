To create a visually appealing solution for sleeping without immediately drawing the eye to the bed when entering the room. To create additional storage space, as space was very limited in the one-room apartment. With this solution, the bed was raised above head height, giving the resident the opportunity to store many items and their clothes underneath. The visible side facing the room was covered with a large shelf, which contributes to the room design and also provides storage space. This piece of furniture conceals the room niche and creates clear edges, while at the same time solving all the problems that existed previously.",

      content: "I am an architect with over five years of experience in the construction and renovation of houses and apartments, as well as in the design of interior and exterior spaces. My focus is on combining functionality and aesthetic beauty—because spaces should not only look good, but also enrich the everyday lives of their inhabitants. My journey began with studying architecture, where I developed a deep understanding of spatial relationships, structural integrity, and the influence of environments on our well-being.",
      content2: "My journey began with studying architecture, where I developed a deep understanding of spatial relationships, structural integrity, and the influence of environments on our well-being. Throughout my professional career, I have been involved in numerous projects – from residential buildings to commercial spaces – always with a focus on the needs of the users. I have gained valuable experience, particularly in the maintenance, renovation, and contemporary redesign of apartments.",
      content3: "Over time, my focus shifted increasingly to designing individual pieces of furniture. This is where I discovered my passion for tailor-made solutions that are not only functional but also tell a story. This passion led me to specialize in interior concepts and interior design—because many rooms harbor untapped potential that can be revealed and experienced through intelligent planning. Changing circumstances often present us with new challenges. But especially in urban areas, where living space is scarce, a lot can be gained through well-thought-out concepts and targeted redesign. My approach is always personal and collaborative: every room should reflect the character and lifestyle of its inhabitants without losing its timeless elegance. Whether it's the transformation of an entire room or a single, striking statement piece of furniture, I combine traditional craftsmanship with modern design principles to create durable, high-quality results. Together, we develop a solution that perfectly suits your individual living situation.",

        "Ich bin Architekt mit über fünf Jahren Erfahrung im Aus- und Umbau von Häusern, Wohnungen sowie in der Gestaltung von Innen- und Außenräumen. Mein Fokus liegt darauf, Funktionalität und ästhetische Schönheit zu verbinden – denn Räume sollten nicht nur gut aussehen, sondern auch den Alltag ihrer Bewohner bereichern. Mein Weg begann mit dem Architekturstudium, in dem ich ein tiefes Verständnis für räumliche Zusammenhänge, strukturelle Integrität und den Einfluss von Umgebungen auf unser Wohlbefinden entwickelte.",
      content2: "In meiner beruflichen Laufbahn habe ich an zahlreichen Projekten mitgewirkt – von Wohnhäusern bis hin zu Gewerbeflächen –, stets mit dem Blick auf die Bedürfnisse der Nutzer. Besonders in der Instandhaltung, Sanierung und zeitgemäßen Neugestaltung von Wohnungen konnte ich wertvolle Erfahrung sammeln.",
      content3: "Mit der Zeit verlagerte sich mein Schwerpunkt zunehmend auf die Gestaltung individueller Möbelstücke. Hier entdeckte ich meine Leidenschaft für maßgeschneiderte Lösungen, die nicht nur funktional sind, sondern auch eine Geschichte erzählen. Diese Leidenschaft führte mich zu meiner Spezialisierung auf Innenraumkonzepte und Interior Design – denn viele Räume bergen ungenutztes Potenzial, das durch intelligente Planung sichtbar und erlebbar wird.Veränderte Lebensumstände stellen uns oft vor neue Herausforderungen. Doch gerade im urbanen Raum, wo Wohnfläche knapp ist, kann durch durchdachte Konzepte und gezielte Umgestaltung enorm viel gewonnen werden. Mein Ansatz ist dabei immer persönlich und kollaborativ: Jeder Raum sollte den Charakter und Lebensstil seiner Bewohner widerspiegeln, ohne dabei seine zeitlose Eleganz zu verlieren.Ob es um die Transformation eines kompletten Raumes oder um ein einzelnes, prägnantes Statement-Möbel geht – ich verbinde traditionelle Handwerkstechniken mit modernen Designprinzipien, um langlebige, hochwertige Ergebnisse zu schaffen. Gemeinsam entwickeln wir eine Lösung, die perfekt zu Ihrer individuellen Wohnsituation passt.",

Crear una solución visualmente atractiva para dormir sin que la cama llamara inmediatamente la atención al entrar en la habitación. Crear espacio de almacenamiento adicional, ya que el espacio era muy limitado en el apartamento de una sola habitación. Con esta solución, la cama se elevó por encima de la altura de la cabeza, lo que le da al residente la oportunidad de guardar muchos artículos y su ropa debajo. El lado visible que da a la habitación se cubrió con un gran estante, que contribuye al diseño de la habitación y también proporciona espacio de almacenamiento. Este mueble oculta el nicho de la habitación y crea bordes claros, al tiempo que resuelve todos los problemas que existían anteriormente",

Mi objetivo es combinar la funcionalidad y la belleza estética, ya que los espacios no solo deben tener un aspecto atractivo, sino también enriquecer la vida cotidiana de sus habitantes.",
      content2: "Mi trayectoria comenzó con los estudios de arquitectura, en los que desarrollé una profunda comprensión de las relaciones espaciales, la integridad estructural y la influencia de los entornos en nuestro bienestar. A lo largo de mi carrera profesional, he participado en numerosos proyectos, desde viviendas hasta espacios comerciales, siempre teniendo en cuenta las necesidades de los usuarios. He adquirido una valiosa experiencia, especialmente en el mantenimiento, la rehabilitación y el rediseño contemporáneo de viviendas.",
      content3: "Con el tiempo, mi enfoque se fue desplazando cada vez más hacia el diseño de muebles individuales. Aquí descubrí mi pasión por las soluciones a medida, que no solo son funcionales, sino que también cuentan una historia. Esta pasión me llevó a especializarme en conceptos de interiorismo y diseño de interiores, ya que muchos espacios esconden un potencial sin explotar que se hace visible y tangible gracias a una planificación inteligente. Los cambios en las circunstancias de la vida a menudo nos plantean nuevos retos. Sin embargo, precisamente en las zonas urbanas, donde el espacio habitable es escaso, se puede ganar mucho con conceptos bien pensados y remodelaciones específicas. Mi enfoque es siempre personal y colaborativo: cada espacio debe reflejar el carácter y el estilo de vida de sus habitantes, sin perder su elegancia atemporal. Ya se trate de la transformación de una habitación completa o de un mueble único y llamativo, combino las técnicas artesanales tradicionales con los principios del diseño moderno para crear resultados duraderos y de alta calidad. Juntos desarrollamos una solución que se adapta perfectamente a su situación particular.",
